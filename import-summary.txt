ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* Android.mk
* ForceProguard.mk
* build/
* build/README
* build/android_lint.mk
* build/android_lint.xslt
* build/colorize_errors.py
* build/gcheckstyle.mk
* build/gcheckstyle/
* build/gcheckstyle/google-style-checker_deploy.jar
* build/gcheckstyle/tools/
* build/gcheckstyle/tools/java/
* build/gcheckstyle/tools/java/checkstyle/
* build/gcheckstyle/tools/java/checkstyle/googlestyle-5.0.xml
* build/process_style_output.py
* proguard-release.flags
* proguard-test.flags
* proguard.flags
* tests/
* tests/Android.mk
* tools/
* tools/buglesql
* tools/dumpapkversion.sh
* tools/messagegen/
* tools/messagegen/fillsms
* tools/messagegen/listimages
* tools/mmssql
* version.mk

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => app/src/main/assets/
* jni/ => app/src/main/jni/
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/
* src/com/android/messaging/ui/mediapicker/camerafocus/README.txt => app/src/main/resources/com/android/messaging/ui/mediapicker/camerafocus/README.txt
* tests/src/ => app/src/androidTest/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
